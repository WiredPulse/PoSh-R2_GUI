PowerShell - Rapid Response (PoSH-R2)... For the incident responder in you!
        
PoSH-R2 is a set of Windows Management Instrumentation interface (WMI) scripts that investigators and forensic analysts can use to retrieve information from a compromised (or potentially compromised) Windows system. The scripts use WMI to pull this information from the operating system. Therefore, this script will need to be executed with a user that has the necessary privileges.
<br>
<br>
In a single execution, PoSH-R2 will retrieve the following data from an individual machine or a group of systems:
<br>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Autorun entries <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Disk info <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Environment variables <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Event logs (50 lastest) <br>
