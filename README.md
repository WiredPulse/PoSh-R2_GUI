# PoSh-R2_GUI
GUI version of PowerShell - Rapid Response (PoSH-R2)... For the incident responder in you!<br>https://github.com/WiredPulse/PoSh-R2

PoSH-R2 is a set of Windows Management Instrumentation interface (WMI) scripts that investigators and forensic analysts can use to retrieve information from a compromised (or potentially compromised) Windows system. The scripts use WMI to pull this information from the operating system. Therefore, this script will need to be executed with a user that has the necessary privileges.
